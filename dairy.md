Figured out drag-and-drop mechanic, barrier for canvas (needs reworking)
Plan for tomorrow: figure out collision and connection

Tue 14/1/2025:
Smoothed out drag-n-drop, successfully implemented collision side detection + rudementary snapping function, start background art
Plan for tomorrow: grouping, correct slotting

Wed 15/1/2025:
Algorithm so only correct pieces "snap", pictures get automatically cut into puzzles, snap v1 (correct pieces attach and move with moving piece, collision with other correct piece has it jump to correct position and join movment, but stops being a group when let go)
