Smoothed out drag-n-drop, successfully implemented collision side detection + rudementary snapping function, start background art
Plan for tomorrow: grouping, correct slotting

Wed 15/01/2025:
Algorithm so only correct pieces "snap", pictures get automatically cut into puzzles, snap v1 (correct pieces attach and move with moving piece, collision with other correct piece has it jump to correct position and join movment, but stops being a group when let go)
Plan for tomorrow: re-do snap (new object to keep pieces that moves instead)

Thu 16/01/2025:
Fixed Issue with Algorithm where last of row  would snap to side of first of next row, snap v2 (correct pieces snap and continue moving if picked up again, but two "groups" meeting messes things up), snap v3 (i cannot describe this mess but its getting there)
